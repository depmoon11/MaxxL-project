                    “See Naples and die!” The famous saying, popularised by 18th-century German writer Goethe, is an affectionate nod to the beauty of the southern Italian port city, enveloped by its cerulean bay and crowned by Mount Vesuvius.
                    But nowadays, the catchphrase has taken a whole new meaning.
                    As the much-maligned epicentre of Italy’s ferocious Camorra gang, Naples often tops tourists’ naughty list of no-go cities.
                    While Naples may have once been the glorious capital of a kingdom - testified by its opulent architecture and esteemed culinary creations - much of this has faded in comparison to the incessant trashing it gets in the press.
                    News of the city is often accompanied by lurid images of urban decay and squalor. Roberto Saviano’s popular ‘Gomorrah’ investigative journalism series, depicting the grittiness of life in the Neapolitan suburbs, has further helped consolidate its image as a crime-ridden and trash-laden urban jungle.
                    It comes as little surprise that tourists generally steer clear of Naples, merely stopping en route to Capri and Amalfi’s beaches or Pompeii’s ruins.
                    But now that Naples and its residents are actively fighting to shake off its bad image, is it time we embraced the unspoken beauties the city has to offer and lay negative stereotypes to rest?
                    Here’s why Naples should top your travel bucket list in 2024 - and why it’s criminal to skip it..

                    Following Naples’ historical fall from grace, the city’s long struggle with poverty and crime has led it to be rejected by Italians and tourists alike.
                    Indeed, rejection is at the heart of the city’s very own founding mythology. As legend has it, the siren Parthenope killed herself after being rejected by Odysseus, and was washed to the shores of what would later become Naples.

                    At the risk of igniting culinary wars, I'd back Naples as Italy’s food capital (Bologna a close second).
                    It’s the city that gave us pizza after all, with the Margherita - created to honour Italy’s queen in 1889 - being a time-honoured staple at renowned pizzerias like Da Michele or Gino Sorbillo.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Naples is an unexpected delight at Christmas</h2>
                <p>
                    Naples and Christmas don’t seem like an obvious pairing. The city’s Mediterranean setting doesn’t immediately evoke Hallmark-ready images of a white Christmas.
                    Indeed, winter temperatures in the city tend to stay rather autumnal, hovering around the mid-teens by day and almost never dropping below zero.
